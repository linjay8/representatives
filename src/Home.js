            BuyNothing offers people a way to give and receive, share, lend, and
            express gratitude through a worldwide gift economy network in which
            the true wealth is the web of connections formed between people. We
            believe that communities are more resilient, sustainable, equitable,
            and joyful when they have functional gift economies.

              This is an imagined extension of a pre-existing project
              (buynothingproject.org). I am not affiliated with the Buy Nothing
              Project nor am I implying that this is an original concept. I am
              only the creator of this web project and the functionalities of
              this specific application. If you are curious about actually
              joining a Buy Nothing group, visit their real website and find out
              ways to take part in a group near you.
